## Usage

Currently, the plugin only **supports sending**.  
Receiving will be added in a future update.

### Sending a Spout Source

By default, a **global sender** is available. You can use:

- **Start Spout Broadcasting**  
  Pass a **Name**, **Render Target**, and **FPS** (set `FPS = 0` for a one-time static texture).

- **Stop Spout Broadcasting**  
  Stops updating the texture.

### SpoutSender Component

For multiple senders:

- Add a **SpoutSender** component to any Actor.
- Set the **Name**, **Render Target**, and **FPS** in the **Details Panel**.
- Broadcasting starts automatically on `BeginPlay`.

You can also control broadcasting manually using Blueprint calls:
- `Start Broadcasting`
- `Stop Broadcasting`

> Tip: Use `FPS = 0` for static, one-time texture send.
